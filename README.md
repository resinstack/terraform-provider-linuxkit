# terraform-provider-linuxkit

This is, as the name suggests, a terraform provider for working with
LinuxKit.  Right now all it does is provide a data source which
formats metadata files.

To install it you can either compile it locally with `go build` or you
can obtain a precompiled release.

Once you have obtained a copy, you can install it in
`~/.terraform.d/plugins/`.
